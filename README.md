# Circuit Breaker Pattern in Java 17 with Spring Boot

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Circuit Breaker design pattern in Java 17 using Spring Boot. The Circuit Breaker pattern helps enhance the resilience of applications by preventing cascading failures and providing fallback mechanisms during service outages.

## Features:

- **Spring Boot Integration:** Utilizes the Spring Boot framework to implement the Circuit Breaker pattern seamlessly within a Java application.

- **Resilience and Fault Tolerance:** Enhances the application's robustness by intelligently handling and mitigating failures in external services.

- **Fallback Mechanism:** Implements a fallback mechanism to gracefully handle service outages or degraded performance.

- **Example Usage:** Includes a practical example or scenario demonstrating the Circuit Breaker pattern in action.

## Getting Started:

1. Ensure you have Java 17 and Maven installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ImanolSuppo/Spring-boot-Circuit-breaker.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Spring-boot-Circuit-breaker`
4. Build the project: `mvn clean install`
5. Run the application: `java -jar target/your-application.jar`

Explore the implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern in a Spring Boot application and learn how it can contribute to the overall resilience of your system.
